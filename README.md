# Can My Dog Eat This? App

### Site Functionality:
The goal of the application was to create a site where people could input a food or ingredient that they might want to give their dog or that the dog already ate. The website would tell the user if the food was safe for canine consumption. If not, an emergency contact link would be provided to the user, with the nearest Veternary Hospital's address and contact information would be provided.

### Link to Site:
